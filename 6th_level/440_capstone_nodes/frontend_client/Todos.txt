// TODO Get rid of updateDBnState??? check all places i make axios calls and do them all considantly (where possible)

// TODO Delete breaks if delete node with children
1) Crashes on move cursor to next (if lots of children) probably because if it takes long, the next doesn't exits
2) Doesn't delete childrens children from allNodes (and probably the DB)

// TODO - Add new Child Task
// TODO     It's broken if no siblings or children
// TODO     Maybe add logic so it looks at cursor (end or beginning) to decide if new node is child or sibling
// TODO     Or maybe use Shift Alt Enter to do the different kinds of add node???

// TODO add logic to handle errors
// TODO     ...if first/last node in array (for moveCursor, moveNode, promote, & demote)
// TODO     ...when deleting last child in from list of children

// TODO Move any functions that I can to above NodeContextProvider (should still be able to include in useNodeContext) 
// TODO - Change to use allNodes[thisNodeId] for fields instead of thisNode
// TODO Change parameters/arguments (everywhere) to use _id instead of whole node???
// TODO add alert if error on any/all api calls


// TODO Is there a better way to make cursor go to begining of input on up/down arrow?
// TODO make it so if cursor in middle of line, text after cursor becomes new item and that text is removed from current node (i.e. like a carriage return)


// TODO - Add collapse/expand children
// TODO - Add SVG icons: Todo, Done, Bullet, plain text (with invisible icon)
// TODO - Add way to change type (bullet, todo, plain text)
// TODO - Add reminder
// TODO - Add speak reminder
// TODO - Look at proposal for more
// TODO - Put this on actual public website to see how well it works
// TODO - Add "Tags" feature (for sorting and filtering)
