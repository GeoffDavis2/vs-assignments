        <h3>LANGLEY, VA - A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</h3>
        <h3>According to the report, sections of the documents = "almost invariably the most crucial passages" - are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossilbe to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</h3>
        <h3>CIA Director <b>Porter goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>the Cold War</li>
                <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
                <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
            </ul></h3>
